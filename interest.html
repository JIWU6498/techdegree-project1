         <h2>About Claude Monet</h2>
         <p>Claude Mone was a French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most consistent and
            prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature,
            especially as applied to Plein air landscape painting.</p>
         <p>The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, Soleil levant (Impression,
            Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted
            by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.</p>

         <h2>Story</h2>
         <p>Claude Monet was in almost every sense the founder of French Impressionist painting, the term itself coming
            from one of his paintings, Impression, Sunrise. As a child, his father wanted him to go into the grocery
            business, but his heart was in the profession of artistry, and at age 11, he entered Le Havre secondary
            school of the arts. During his stay at the secondary school, he was known for the caricatures he would draw
            for the locals for ten to twenty francs each.</p>

         <h2>Artists By Genre</h2>
         <p>Usually artists work in different genres, not limiting themselves to one specific genre. However, there are
            artists who are marked by art historians as representatives of a particular genre, in which their creative
            career reached its height.
